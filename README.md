# Lab05_Dylan_Joy

## Overview
3 binary classification models that automate training, evaluation, and reporting:
- Logistic Regression (benchmark)
- Random Forest
- GaussianNB

Generates a report summarizing EDA, preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, SHAP analysis, and PSI calculation.

## Folder Structure
- `bankrupt+models.py` - main model build
- `training_pipeline.py` – main pipeline script
- `data.csv` – input dataset
- `artifacts/` – output folder
  - `report.md` – comprehensive report
  - `models/` – saved model files
  - `prep/` – scaler, imputer, selected features
  - `plots/` – EDA, PSI, calibration, ROC, SHAP visuals

## How to Run
1. Activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\activate
